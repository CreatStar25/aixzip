  "faq": [
    { "q": "Does it work on NanoBanana images?", "a": "Yes! NanoBanana uses the same underlying technology as Gemini for image generation. Our algorithm perfectly detects and removes the characteristic translucent strip found on both." },
    { "q": "How does it remove the watermark without blurring?", "a": "Unlike standard 'healing' tools that blur the area, our AI calculates the exact pixel values hidden behind the semi-transparent watermark layer, mathematically restoring the original image." },
    { "q": "Will my photos be uploaded to a server?", "a": "No. All processing happens 100% locally in your browser using WebAssembly. Your images never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy." },
    { "q": "Does it remove SynthID (invisible watermarks)?", "a": "We primarily focus on removing visible artifacts (the strip) to restore visual aesthetics. While the re-encoding process may disrupt digital signatures like SynthID, we do not guarantee complete removal of invisible cryptographic watermarks." },
    { "q": "Is there a limit on how many images I can process?", "a": "No limits. Since it runs on your own device, you can process as many images as your computer's memory handles." }
