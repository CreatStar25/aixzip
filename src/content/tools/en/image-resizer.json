  "faq": [
    { "q": "Will my images be distorted?", "a": "No. By default, we lock the aspect ratio. If you change the width, the height adjusts automatically to keep the image proportion correct." },
    { "q": "Is there a limit on file size?", "a": "Since processing happens locally on your device, the limit depends on your computer's memory (RAM), not our server. You can typically process hundreds of images." },
    { "q": "Does it support transparent PNGs?", "a": "Yes, resizing preserves the transparency channel in PNG and WebP files." }
